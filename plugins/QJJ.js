  🌀 *v1.0.0 - The Beginning*

  ➥ Started with just *7 commands*, but already more powerful than you.  
  
  💀 *v1.1.0 - The Expansion*  
  ➥ Grew to *150+ commands*.  
  ➥ More insults, more savagery—users suffered even more.  
  
  🔥 *v1.2.0 - Domination*  
  ➥ Now boasting *300+ commands*, pure chaos.  
  ➥ VRT became even more toxic, crushing weaklings.  
  
  ⚠️ *v1.3.0 - The Death & Resurrection*  
  ➥ This version almost killed VRT—errors, failures, suffering.  
  ➥ Panel deployment failed, sharp messed up, but *VRT never dies*.  
  
  ⚡ *v1.4.0 - The Rebirth*  
  ➥ Custom plugins added—create your own chaos.  
  ➥ Better menu, even more disrespectful responses.  
  ➥ The VRT motto *“VRT isn’t for the weak”* became official.  
  
  💥 *v1.5.0 - Coming Soon*  
  ➥ Update command added—because you people can’t do anything yourselves.  
  ➥ Change bot picture—give VRT a new face (not that it needs one).  
  ➥ Meme command returns—because your life needs comedy.
